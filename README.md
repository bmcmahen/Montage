Montage is an experimental home media center developeed with the Raspberry Pi in mind. It is very much a __work in progress__ and is bound to explode at any moment. The goal is to create an xmbc-like media player that is controlled entirely through a web interface on your mobile device. This is also an experimentation with building a (mobile) web application entirely in HTML5 and Javascript.

It currently requires Node > 0.10 and GraphicsMagick.

Primary target platform right now are tablets, namely the iPad (which I can test with), but the goal is to make an application that is cross-platform -- for phones, tablets, desktops.

## Features

- automated library management and metadata retrieval
- integrated bittorrent client, there mostly as a "proof of concept" for integrating video discovery and retrieval into the application
- stream videos to your local tablet, computer, phone, or on your remote device (television hooked up to the server)
