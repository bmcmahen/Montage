Flicks is an experimental home media center for the Raspberry Pi. The concept: Flicks, installed on your Raspberry pi, will expose an API that allows you to organize your video library and control playback of your videos from other devices, like your tablet or phone. You can choose to play the video on your raspberry pi, or on your tablet/phone.

This is very much a __work in progress__ and is highly experimental. It requires the node 0.11.3 running with the `--harmony-generators` flag. The goal is to eventually package this into something that's easy to install and use.
